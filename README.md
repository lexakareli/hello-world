Hello indeed!

Alexa here, go ahead, you can ask me anything ;) 
Just kidding, that's just my name and what people call me. 
Since it's already a short enough name, there's no need to make it shorter by giving me a nickname. 

I do get asked a lot if that's my FULL name, or if it is a condensed form of Alexandra, Alexandria, Alejandra, etc. 
To answer that simply, it is.
My full first name is Alexa and I'm perfectly fine with that. 

Thanks for reading! 
I look forward to working with you soon :)
